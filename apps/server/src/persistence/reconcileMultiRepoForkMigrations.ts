 *
 * Depending on the build, the fork recorded its own migrations at 52-59 or 55-59, and re-ran
 * main's 52-54 inside `HealSkippedRenumberedMigrations`. Left alone, the migrator would treat 55
 * (OrchestrationV2) and 56 as already applied. This re-asserts 52-54, which is idempotent,
 * replaces the fork rows with main's names, and lets the migrator run 55 onward normally.
